Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programed. ML is one of the most exciting technologies that one would have ever come across. As it is visible from the name, it gives the computer that makes it more similar to humans.

### We will generate random datasets using the Numpy library in Python.
 
Libraries needed:

1. Numpy: pip3 install numpy
2. Pandas: pip3 install pandas
3. Matplotlib: pip3 install matplotlib
